# course-ripper
A little python script I wrote to make choosing courses for my last year of uni easier by pulling only the ones available to me off the website and putting them into a LATEX pdf.

It's a real mess. Due to the nature of the websites I was pulling data from. which was also a real mess, I had to get a bit creative with the way I snatched data from the raw HTML. I'm not currently aware of a better way of doing it, but I'm almost certain that there's one out there. Either way, it does it's job (which it was only meant to do once and then never be used again), but for my future reference I'd like to know how to do things better.

If anyone seeing this has some input to make this more streamlined, please do let me know.
